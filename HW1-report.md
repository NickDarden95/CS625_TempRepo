*Big air snowboarding* is an **extreme winter sport** that involves performing aerial tricks off a large jump, combining **_speed, technique, and creativity_** to score points. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, **Brock Crouch (USA)** won the event, and in 2018 **Sebastien Toutant (Canada) **. Athletes often spend years perfecting their tricks, such as the `frontside triple cork 1440`, which requires precise timing and aerial awareness. To learn more about the history and evolution of big air snowboarding, visit the [official Olympics website](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games).
